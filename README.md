### ***Description***
#### "Science should be accessible to everyone". 

####  [Scienteer](https://scienteer-sbassong.vercel.app/) is a citizen science management platform which allows Science enthusiasts to find and contribute to research projects throughout the world. This application attempts to leverage the largely untapped power of crowd sourcing in scientific research to promote science engagement. Scienteer aims to connect the lay person and scientists while promoting collaboration and spreading science literacy. This fully full-stack web app is implemented with Vue/Vuex/Vutify to render a smooth and responsive user interface, Flask and PostgreSQL to handle routing and database operations in the backend. Scienteer utilizes the Bcrypt and JWT Authentication for a protected user experience, as well as the google maps API for geocaching. Scienteer is my capstone project for Software Engineering Immersive @ General Assembly.
